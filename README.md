# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
This analysis will examine Ride Sharing data for the PyBer ride sharing service across urban, suburban, and rural cities. Each city type will be analyzed on total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver.

## Results
There is a distinct stratification of the PyBer experience as it relates to city types. The rural cities have the fewest number of rides and drivers, but the highest average fare per ride and per driver. Conversely, the urban cities have the largestr number of rides and drivers, and the lowest average fare per ride and driver.

The Total Fares by City Type graph below shows that while there is fluxuation over time, the urban cities regularly bring in more fares than the suburban cities, which bring in more fares than the rural cities.

## Summary
One of the reason the rural communities may have low numbers of rides, is that they find the cost prohibitive. There are several recommendations for PyBer to address this disparity between city types. 
- Lower the base fare for rural communnities
- Provide incentive for rural drivers
- Implement discounts for events in rural areas that will promote ridesharing rather than overfilling the existing parking options.
